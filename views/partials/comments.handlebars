{{!-- comments are part of an array and therefore we cannot simply name the property name; we will use this since technically all data passed to a template file is always part of this, but when dealing with objects, we can simply access the object properties directly (e.g. vote_count instead of this.vote_count) --}}

{{!-- Below changed post.comments to this --}}

<div class="comments">
  {{#each this}}
  <section class="comment">
    <div class="meta">
      {{user.username}} on {{format_date created_at}}
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      {{comment_text}}
    </div>
  </section>
  {{/each}}
</div>
